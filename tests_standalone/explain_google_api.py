📋 How Google APIs Work:

1️⃣  **API KEY (GOOGLE_API_KEY)**:
   - This is your authentication credential
   - It identifies WHO you are and which project you belong to
   - It's like having a "library card" 
   - ✅ Your key: AIzaSyAM5OgW2nU... is VALID

2️⃣  **API SERVICE ENABLEMENT**:
   - This determines WHICH services your project can access
   - It's like having "permission to enter specific sections" of the library
   - Even with a valid library card, you can't enter sections that are "closed"
   - ❌ Your project has Generative Language API "closed/disabled"

🔗 **The Relationship**:
   ```
   Valid API Key + Enabled Service = ✅ API Calls Work
   Valid API Key + Disabled Service = ❌ 403 SERVICE_DISABLED
   ```

💡 **Why Both Are Needed**:
   - API Key: Proves you're authorized to make requests
   - Service Enable: Grants permission to use specific Google services
   - Google requires BOTH for security and billing control

🎯 **Your Current Situation**:
   ✅ GOOGLE_API_KEY: Working perfectly (authentication succeeds)
   ❌ Generative Language API: Disabled (service access denied)
   
   Result: 403 SERVICE_DISABLED error

🛠️  **Why Can't API Key Alone Work?**

Google's security model requires TWO levels of permission:
1. **Authentication** (API Key) ← ✅ You have this
2. **Authorization** (Service Enabled) ← ❌ Missing this

This prevents:
- Accidental usage of expensive services
- Unauthorized access to sensitive APIs
- Billing surprises from unused services

🔐 **Think of it like a hotel**:
- API Key = Your room keycard (proves you're a guest)
- Service Enable = Permission to use gym/pool/spa
- You need BOTH the keycard AND pool access to swim

⚡ **Quick Fix Required**:
   
   Your API key is perfect! Just need to "unlock" the service:
   
   1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/generativelanguage.googleapis.com?project=1007551429936
   2. Click "ENABLE" (this is free - no charges until you use it)
   3. Wait 1-2 minutes for Google's systems to update
   4. Test: Your existing API key will immediately work!

🎉 **After Enabling**:
   Same API key + Enabled service = Gemini API calls work perfectly!
