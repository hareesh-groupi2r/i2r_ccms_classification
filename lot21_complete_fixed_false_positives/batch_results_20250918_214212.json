Tamil Nadu.\nPage 2:\nHence, our scope of providing W-Beam Crash Barrier is limited to 660m as per above table pursuant to clause 8.3 of Schedule-B. The same was reiterated by us in project review meetings dated 06.01.18 & . 03.05.18 and the same were acknowledged in Authority Engineer Letter under reference (3). After this, the Authority Engineer vide his letter under reference (1) instructed that the W-Beam crash ' barrier are to be Provided as per Part 3 Drawings as mentioned in Schedule-B as well as Schedule-D and list of locations for a length of 29,038m. But, this was not accepted by us vide our letter under reference (2) above,wherein we have stated that the all high embankment locations, Minor Bridge approaches would be carried out under change of scope after careful examination of Schedule-B, Schedule-D and Section 9 of the Manual. \u2018In continuation to this, The Authority Engineer vide letter under reference (3) communicated that the Authority also of the same contention that W-Beam crash barrier are to be Provided as per Part 3 Drawings and Schedule-B of the EPC Agreement and we were instructed to propose the locations based _ on these. In response to this instruction of Authority Engineer, vide our letter under reference (4),we proposed locations in line with the Part -3 drawings and Schedule-B even though our contention was that our scope of providing W-Beam Crash Barrier is only 660m as mentioned in clause 8.3 of Schedule- B. As the above issue was lingering for long period and the Scheduled Project Completion was nearing, in order to finalise the issue, the Superintendent Engineer of Authority conducted joint site inspection on 22.06.18 and identified the locations and instructed us to provide W-Beam Crash Barrier for a Length of 11225 m.The location details of W-beam crash barrier provided at Site as per instructions given during instructed by the Superintendent Engineer of Authority during Joint Site inspection is enclosed as Annexure-l. _ We had provided W-Beam Crash Barrier as per the instruction of the Superintendent Engineer of Authority even though our scope was limited'to Schedule-B. Being the professional Contracting firm, this work was carried out only in the interest of completion of the project as per Schedule-J of the Project . wherein our objection/raising the dispute in this regard at that time might have delayed the completion of the project as the issue was lingering for long time. As the scope of providing W-Beam Crash Barrier is only 660m as per Schedule-B of the Contract Agreement, the Additional Length of 10,565m (11225-660 =10565m) of W-Beam Crash Barrier provided in actual is to be treated as change of scope under Article 13 of the EPC Agreement and Change of Scope notice is required to be issued under clause 13.2.",

The proposed locations are as follows. 1. Pipe Culverts : Single W Beam 2. Minor Bridge approaches : Double W Beam \u2014 Under change of scope. 3. Retaining wall at Pond locations: Double W Beam \u2014 Under change of scope. 4. Embankment Height > 3m : Double W Beam \u2014 Under change of scope. The above stated Schedule-B and Schedule-D do not warrant the locations where curve radii is less than 450m radii in general and Box / Slab culverts are already provided with RCC barrier (Rigid). Hence these locations as stated under your list are not considered by us. In this connection, we inform you that the double W beam is proposed as per your suggestions and the additional cost implication towards the increase in height and nos. of W Beams on account of the same do attract \u201cChange of scope (COS)\u201d as per article 13.1.2 of contract. The proposal for the same will be communicated in due course upon finalization of quantum of works. This is for your kind information and approvals, please.

We hereby bring your kind attention on our proposal submitted vide our letter reference (1) above. Please be noted that we have been suggested by TNRSP to select \u201calternate similar materials\u201d in place of the \u201cbase material (which is as per contract)\u201d due to non-availability of price indices since 01.04.2017 onwards. Hence as per the same, we have analyzed the price variation trend of the alternate materials in comparison with base material to derive linking factor. As the trend of price indices variation of the identified alternate materials differ from the price indices variation trend of base materials for the previous period (ie., before 01.04.17), we have arrived a correlation factor to apply upon linking factor which is arrived by direct method. Thus proposed linking factor is derived. Hope our submitted analysis particulars may brief you in detail under this subject. We hereby sincerely request your good self to review our previous submission once again and kindly append the linking factor as proposed by us. This is for your kind information and approval please.

During the Project Review Meeting on 06.01.2018 and 03.05.2018 it was discussed and concluded that Metal Beam Crash Barrier shall be provided as per Schedule B and Part III Drawings of the EPC Contract Agreement and we have already clarified this to you several times. Now the Authority vide their letter cited at 3 above once again reiterated that the length of Metal Beam Crash Barrier as per Schedule B of the EPC Contract Agreement and Part II! Drawings are the bare Minimum requirement of the Project. It is also clarified that only Single Beam Metal Beam Crash Barrier shall be provided. The Metal Beam Crash Barrier has to be installed to the length as indicated by the Part Ill drawings and Schedule B of the EPC Contract Agreement which lies as the Scope of the EPC Contract Agreement. The Location may be interchanged and finalised as per the site requirement if necessary by having a joint site inspection along with the representatives of Authority, CSC and the Contractor. Hence you are advised to proceed the work of Metal Beam Crash Barrier as per Schedule B and Part Ill Drawings of the EPC Contract Agreement and complete it at the earliest. Thanking you.
