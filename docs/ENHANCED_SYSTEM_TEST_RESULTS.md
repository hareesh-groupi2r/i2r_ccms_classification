### Phase 2: Issue-to-Category Mapping
- **1-to-Many Relationships**: Properly showing multiple categories per issue
- **Example**: "Utility shifting" mapped to both "EoT" and "Authority's Obligations"
- **Categories Mapped**: 6 categories from 5 semantic issues

### Phase 3: LLM Validation
- **Model Used**: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- **Temperature**: 0.0 (deterministic)
- **Seed**: 42 (reproducible)
- **Issue Types Available**: 184 (vs 107 before enhancement)
- **New Issues Added**: "Change of Scope Proposals" detected by LLM
- **Processing Time**: ~13 seconds

### Phase 4: Validation Filtering
- **Hallucination Detection**: All 4 issues passed validation
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Applied successfully
- **Data Sufficiency**: Warning level adjustments applied

### Phase 5: Source Priority
- **Priority Order**: LLM validation > semantic search (working correctly)
- **Final Issues**: 4 issues after priority filtering
- **Evidence**: Complete text evidence provided for each issue
