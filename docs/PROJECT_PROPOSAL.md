# Contract Correspondence Multi-Category Classification System
## Project Proposal

### Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an intelligent classification system for contract correspondence in infrastructure projects. The system will automatically identify multiple issues within contract letters and assign appropriate categories, reducing manual review effort and ensuring consistency across document classification.

### Problem Statement
- **Current Challenge**: Manual review of contract correspondence is time-consuming and inconsistent across different reviewers
- **Volume**: Processing 20-50 documents daily with potential for batch processing
- **Complexity**: Single documents often address multiple issues requiring multi-label classification
- **Accuracy Requirement**: Minimum 85% accuracy with emphasis on minimizing false negatives (<5%)

### Proposed Solution
A modular multi-approach classification system with 5 configurable methods that can be enabled/disabled for experimentation:

1. **Pure LLM Approach**: Direct document classification using GPT-4/Claude
2. **Hybrid RAG+LLM**: Semantic search with reference database + LLM validation
3. **Fine-tuned LegalBERT**: Domain-specific BERT model trained on legal documents
4. **Google Document AI + Gemini**: Enterprise-grade OCR with Google's latest LLM
5. **Open Source Stack**: DocTR + Mixtral + BGE embeddings for cost-effective processing

### Key Features

#### 1. Multi-Label Classification
- Identifies multiple issues within a single document
- Maps issues to one or more categories
- Provides confidence scores for each classification

#### 2. Issue-Type Based Category Mapping
- Two-phase classification process: Issue identification → Category mapping
- Handles many-to-many relationships (one issue type can map to multiple categories)
- Maintains mapping consistency across documents
- Provides traceability from identified issues to assigned categories

#### 3. Advanced NLP Processing
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base form
- **Stemming**: Further normalizes text variations
- **Sliding Window Embeddings**: Captures context through overlapping text chunks
- **Key Sentence Extraction**: Focuses on most relevant content

#### 4. Comprehensive Metrics
- True/False Positives/Negatives for each classification
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Per-category performance tracking
- Comparative analysis across approaches

#### 5. Active Learning
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Automated retraining triggers
- New category discovery

### Data Overview
- **Training Data**: 523 labeled examples
- **Issue Types**: 130 unique types
- **Categories**: 62 unique categories
- **Multi-label**: 59% of documents have multiple categories
- **Text Length**: Average body ~1,554 characters

### Data Relationship Model

#### Issue-Type to Category Mapping Structure
The system recognizes that each issue type can map to multiple categories, creating a many-to-many relationship:

```
Document Text
     ↓
[Issue Identification Layer]
     ↓
Issue Type(s) Detected
     ↓
[Mapping Layer]
     ↓
Category Labels (Multiple per Issue)
```

**Example Mapping:**
```yaml
Issue Type: "Change of Scope Request"
Mapped Categories:
  - "Contract Amendment"
  - "Cost Impact Assessment"
  - "Schedule Modification"
  - "Risk Management"

Issue Type: "Payment Delay"
Mapped Categories:
  - "Financial Management"
  - "Contract Compliance"
  - "Risk Management"
```

#### Key Statistics:
- **Average categories per issue type**: 2.3
- **Maximum categories for single issue**: 5
- **Overlapping categories across issues**: 40%
- **Unique issue-category pairs**: ~300

This relationship model ensures that:
1. All relevant categories are captured for each issue type
2. Category assignment is consistent across similar documents
3. The system can handle complex documents with multiple overlapping concerns
4. Confidence scores properly propagate from issue identification to category assignment

### Data Quality & Validation

#### Strict Allowlist Validation System
To prevent LLM hallucinations and ensure production reliability:

1. **Validation Engine**
   - Maintains exhaustive lists of 130 valid issue types and 62 valid categories
   - Automatically rejects or corrects any hallucinated values
   - Uses fuzzy matching to find closest valid match when needed
   - Logs all corrections and rejections for monitoring

2. **Constrained Prompting**
   - LLM prompts include explicit lists of valid values
   - Strict instructions to ONLY use provided issue types and categories
   - Multi-layer validation: prompt constraints + post-processing validation

3. **Confidence Adjustment**
   - Reduces confidence scores when auto-correction is applied
   - Flags validated vs. corrected classifications in output

#### Data Sufficiency Analysis

**Current Data Distribution Challenges:**
- **Critical (<5 samples)**: Estimated 15-20% of issue types and categories
- **Warning (5-10 samples)**: Estimated 20-25% of issue types and categories
- **Good (>20 samples)**: Only 40-50% of classifications have sufficient data

**Data Sufficiency Monitoring:**
1. **Real-time Warnings**
   - API responses include data sufficiency warnings
   - Confidence scores automatically adjusted based on training data availability
   - Critical warnings for classifications with <5 training samples

2. **Confidence Multipliers by Data Level**
   - Critical (<5 samples): 50% confidence reduction
   - Warning (5-10 samples): 30% confidence reduction
   - Good (10-20 samples): 15% confidence reduction
   - Excellent (>20 samples): No reduction

3. **Priority Data Collection**
   - Automated reports identify under-represented classifications
   - Priority lists generated for data labeling teams
   - Visualizations show distribution gaps

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Quality**
   - Risk: Limited training data (523 samples)
   - Mitigation: Use pre-trained models, data augmentation, active learning
   - **NEW**: Data sufficiency analyzer identifies critical gaps for targeted collection

2. **LLM Hallucinations**
   - Risk: LLMs generate invalid issue types or categories
   - Mitigation: Strict allowlist validation, constrained prompting, auto-correction
   - **NEW**: All outputs validated against exhaustive lists before returning

3. **Low-Data Classifications**
   - Risk: Poor accuracy for under-represented issue types/categories
   - Mitigation: Confidence adjustments, explicit warnings, priority data collection
   - **NEW**: Real-time data sufficiency warnings in API responses

4. **Long Documents**
   - Risk: Token limits for LLMs
   - Mitigation: Sliding window approach, intelligent chunking

5. **New Categories**
   - Risk: System fails on unseen categories
   - Mitigation: ~~Zero-shot capability~~ Strict validation ensures only known categories
   - **NEW**: New categories must be added to training data before use

6. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: Accuracy drops over time
   - Mitigation: Monitoring, automated retraining, feedback loops

### Success Criteria
1. Achieve >85% classification accuracy on test set
2. Process documents in <5 seconds
3. Successfully integrate with existing Flask backend
4. Demonstrate clear winner among three approaches
5. Establish feedback loop for continuous improvement

- LegalBERT training (Google Colab Pro): $10/month
- Google Cloud setup (if using Document AI): One-time setup
- Mixtral hosting (if self-hosted): $50-100/month for GPU instance

#### Operational Costs (Monthly for 50 docs/day)
| Approach | OCR Cost | LLM Cost | Infrastructure | Total |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Pure LLM | $0 | $75 | $50 | $125 |
| Hybrid RAG | $0 | $15 | $75 | $90 |
| LegalBERT | $0 | $0 | $50 | $50 |
| Google DocAI + Gemini | $3 | $7.50 | $30 | $40.50 |
| DocTR + Mixtral | $0 | $0 | $100 | $100 |

**Note**: Costs can be optimized by selectively enabling approaches based on document complexity

### Recommendation
Deploy all five approaches with modular configuration to:
1. **Experiment Phase**: Enable all approaches, compare metrics on Lot-11 test data
2. **Optimization Phase**: Identify best 2-3 approaches based on accuracy/cost trade-offs
3. **Production Phase**: Use intelligent routing:
   - **Simple documents**: LegalBERT or DocTR+Mixtral (fast, cheap)
   - **Complex documents**: Google DocAI+Gemini or Pure LLM (high accuracy)
   - **Critical documents**: Ensemble of top 3 approaches (maximum confidence)

### Intelligent Document Routing Strategy
```python
def select_approach(document_complexity, criticality, budget):
    if criticality == "high":
        return ["google_docai", "pure_llm", "hybrid_rag"]  # Ensemble
    elif document_complexity == "low":
        return ["legalbert"]  # Fast and cheap
    elif budget == "constrained":
        return ["open_source"]  # DocTR + Mixtral
    else:
        return ["google_docai"]  # Best single approach
```
