#Response format:

#  The response will contain an array of classification results, one for each input text, with
#  categories, issue types, and confidence scores for batch processing.


<<COMMENT
 What metadata provides:

  Batch-level metadata (in response):

  {
    "metadata": {
      "batch_size": 4,        // Total number of texts processed
      "success_rate": 1.0     // Percentage successful (4/4 = 1.0)
    }
  }

  Per-document metadata (for each text):

  - text_length - Character count of processed text
  - processing_time - Time taken for classification
  - approach - Classification method used

  Purpose:

  - Performance monitoring - Track processing times and success rates
  - Quality metrics - Identify problematic batches with low success rates
  - Debugging - Understand processing characteristics per document
  - Operational insights - Help tune batch sizes and parameters
